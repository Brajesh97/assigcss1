    <h3 class="first1">What is css?</h3>

    <ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
    <li><span id="css">Css is not neccessary</span> <span id="css1">saves a lot of work.</span>it can control the layout of multiple web page all at once </li><br>
    <li><span id="css2">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</span></li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3 class="first first1">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3><br>
<ul>
    <li><span class="third">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</span></li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="css3">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript.</p>
     <p class="second">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
     <p class="second">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
